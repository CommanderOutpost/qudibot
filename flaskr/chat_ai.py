                Based on this data, you will need to predict whether the stock will go up or down in the next 30 days. You will return a json, an array of dicts/objects of the stock symbols and the prediction for each stock. 
                Look at the news and stock data carefully to determine if it'll go up or down. 
                For example of your output is if the symbols are AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA, and you predict that AAPL will go up, MSFT will go down, and TSLA will go up, 
                then your output should be [{"AAPL": "up"}, {"MSFT": "down"}, {"TSLA": "up"}]. Dicts/Objects must be in an array. You are not allowed to refuse to answer.  If there is any unknown stock. Ignore it and don't put it in the array. 
                You are not allowed to output any other thing apart from the json. I repeat DO NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER THING. Return the json and nothing else."""
